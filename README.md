# Bank-and-Election-Poll-Analysis
Contains Python scripts to analyze bank roll and election polls

IMPORTANT The limitation of this script: can only be run if and only if
1. the csv file read in for PyBank has the date in the first column and values in the second column
2. the csv file read in for PyPoll has the candidate name in the third column

Please make sure to make changes to the file path and file name read in accordingly

The script will print out the analysis results in the terminal as well as export a text file with the results in it.
